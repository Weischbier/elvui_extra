ElvUI_Extra is an addon for World of Warcraft that enhances the functionality of ElvUI, a popular user interface modification. It introduces additional features and customization options to improve your gaming experience.

- **Show Only Friendly Target Frame**: Toggle this option to display the target frame only when targeting another player to enable the context menu.
- **ElvUI is required**
- **A proper [Plater](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/plater-nameplates) or other Nameplate [profile](https://wago.io/plater) should be used**

## Installation

To install ElvUI_Extra, follow these steps:

1. **Download the Addon**: Get the latest version of ElvUI_Extra from [here](https://github.com/Weischbier/elvui_extra/releases/tag/release).
2. **Extract the Files**: Unzip the downloaded file.
3. **Move to AddOns Folder**: Move the extracted folder (`ElvUI_Extra`) into your WoW addons folder.
   - The addons folder is usually located at `World of Warcraft\_retail_\Interface\AddOns`.
4. **Launch World of Warcraft**: Start the game and make sure ElvUI_Extra is enabled in the AddOns menu.

## Usage

Once installed, you can access the ElvUI_Extra options within the ElvUI configuration menu:

1. Open the game menu by pressing `Esc`.
2. Click on `ElvUI`.
3. Navigate to the `ElvUI_Extra` section to configure its option.

## Important

**Only** use this when you have a proper Plater profile or any other Nameplate addon.
This addon only manipulates the alpha value of the target frame. So it is actually there when you hover over the the area where your target frame is usally displayed and a tooltip will popup.
